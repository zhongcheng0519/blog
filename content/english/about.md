Welcome to my personal website. Born in 1987, I hail from Changzhou, Jiangsu. I began exploring programming from primary school, making me one of the early birds among my peers. Because I met excellent math and physics teachers in middle and high school, I have always been curious about the essence of the world. In college, I started using computers to assist me in better understanding the laws governing our world.

I have always considered the world of computing as a man-made virtual one. However, recent studies increasingly cast doubt on whether the real world we inhabit might also be another virtual world. With the enhancement of computing power, the virtual world inside computers is becoming more and more realistic; meanwhile, the real world is becoming increasingly digitized. Reality and the virtual are resembling each other so much that, as Laozi said, "The name that can be named is not the eternal name." It\'s like the verse in Dream of the Red Chamber: "When the false is taken for the true, then the true becomes false; where nothing is taken for something, then something becomes nothing."

We are living in an era where the virtual and the real are blending, and science and philosophy are illuminating each other. How fortunate we are! Machine learning, big data, AI, AIGC, each decade, we are experiencing earth-shaking changes. Where will we be in ten years?

The internet has made communication more convenient, but being able to browse this is a kind of fate. If we share the same interests and hobbies, I look forward to interacting with you. Let us journey together in this world of truth and illusion, in search of the constant \"truth.\"
